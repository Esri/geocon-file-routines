                        Note that these files are written little-endian.

     libgeocon.c        The source file for the GEOCON routines.

Non-included shift files

   We did not provide the ascii versions of the shift files, nor big-endian
   versions of the binary shift files, as that would have vastly increased
   the size of this package.  These can be created, however, from the
   delivered binary files by using the geocon_file program.

   For example:

      To create an ascii version of the HARN-2007 alaska file:

         geocon_file -o gc_harn_2007_alaska_shifts.gca \
                        gc_harn_2007_alaska_shifts.gcb

      To create a big-endian version of the HARN-2007 alaska file:

         geocon_file -B -o gc_harn_2007_alaska_shifts_be.gcb \
                           gc_harn_2007_alaska_shifts.gcb

      To simply change the HARN-2007 alaska file to be big-endian:

         geocon_file -B -o gc_harn_2007_alaska_shifts.gcb \
                           gc_harn_2007_alaska_shifts.gcb

   Note that the geocon_file and geocon_cvt programs can read any kind of
   multi-grid GEOCON file (ascii, big-endian binary, or little-endian binary).

Non-included error files

   We did not bother to create or deliver any GEOCON error files, as they
   are not used in a GIS environment and that would have doubled the size
   of this package.  However, the geocon_file program can be used to create
   them.  See the appropriate conversion file for details. Note that the
   directory/path names may have to be changed.

   For example, to create a binary version of the 2007 Alaska error file:

      geocon_cmb gc_nad83_harn_2007_alaska_errors.txt

   Note that the geocon_cmb program reads the original single-grid binary
   files.  The user will have to download these files himself (from
   http://beta.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOCON/).
